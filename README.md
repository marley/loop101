# Weather Search app

## About

Weather Search allows users to search for the current weather in any city in the world.

This is an example web app created as teaching material for the Intro to Web Development course at [FrauenLoop](https://www.frauenloop.org/). It is a basic example of what can be done using [React](https://react.dev/). It uses [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for styling and it has an API call.

## To Run

Prerequisite:
Make an account on [The Weather API](weatherapi.com). You will receive an API key that looks something like this: `xo7x97473289b545299gg573829473829`. You can run the visual part of this project without it, but nothing will happen when you try to search.

1. Download this repository (that is, all the files in this project). You will now have a folder in your computer called `loop101`.
2. Inside `loop101` create a file at the root level called `.env`. (Same place as the `.env.example` file)
3. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env`.
4. Copy and paste your API key into the `.env` file.
5. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
7. See the output at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
